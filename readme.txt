VERSE
=====

VERSE supports the following modes of RNA-Seq quantification:
    	1. Original featureCounts (Default)
    	2. HTSeq Union (-z 1)
    	3. HTSeq Intersection-strict (-z 2)
    	4. HTSeq Intersection-nonempty (-z 3)
    	5. VERSE Union-strict (-z 4)
	6. VERSE Cover-length (-z 5)

Supported Quantification Schemes:
	Hierarchical Assign: assign reads to feature types according to their priority.
	Independent Assign: assign reads to feature types independently in a single run.

*** Installation *** 

	You can type "make" to see instructions.
	For Linux OS:
		make -f Makefile.Linux
	For Mac OS, use command:
		make -f Makefile.MacOS

*** Usage ***

Please run "./verse" to see the details.

A sample command:
./verse -a testdata/test.gtf -t 'exon' -g gene_id -z 3 -s 1 -o testdata/intersection_nonempty.stranded.paired testdata/PE.sam

A sample hierarchical assign command:
./verse -a testdata/test.gtf -t 'exon;intron;xine' -g gene_id -z 3 -o testdata/intersection_nonempty.unstranded.paired.hierarchical testdata/PE.sam

VERSE is developed based on the framework of featureCounts(SUBREAD), which is written by Drs Yang Liao and Wei Shi.
